## Objective

The objective of the assignment is to get hands-on experience in developing deep-learning
neural-network models in PyTorch, going through the process of using external (partially
processed) data, preprocess it, and test, train, experiment with, and employ ANN models.

## Description
The financial consulting company UpUpUp Inc. has been operating for over two years, providing various services to its clients, most notably recommendations for opportunistic high-frequency traders taking advantage of (minor) day-to-day variations in stock prices.
Generally speaking, it is believed that the stock market is efficient and transparent enough for such trading not to be profitable, even impossible. Also, UpUpUpâ€˜s track-record in its recommendations so far has been far from stellar, especially with respect to predicting the stock-price movements of high-tech companies. It is thus starting to lose some of its clients.
The company is thus considering stopping offering this service, however, before doing so it
first wants to see if its stock-movement prediction can be improved. All the hype around the
potentials of deep-learning has caught their attention, so the company has contacted you ---
as well as other leading experts in deep learning--- with a business proposal.
The proposal is for building an improved stock-movement prediction model for the stock-
prices of three high-tech companies, the ones it has had the most difficulty with predicting.
Over a period of 90 days, your model will be used to predict the day-to-day stock
movements for the three companies. For each correct prediction you will receive $1,000,
but nothing for wrong predictions. However, the real carrot is, that after this evaluation
period UpUpUp Inc. will pay the expert coming up with the best performing model
$1,000,000 for an exclusive right to its use, as well as financing further model development.

## information about the "Data" folder

### stock_prices.txt
Historical record of the development of the stock-prices of the three companies. The number listed is the stock-price at the close of the market that trading day. All the values have to scaled to be relative to the stock value of each company at the opening of the first day listed (100.0).
